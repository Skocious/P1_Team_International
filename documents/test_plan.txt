    This document will be used to describe the functionality of Project 1 / Expense Reimbursement Application. This
document will outline the features of the application and best practice testing techniques.
    The test methods will include functions to ensure accurate operations and user interactions within the application
framework. For each bug found a unique test case will be created.

[] Test Approach - systematic test of the functions of the application. The tests will ensure proper creation and
management of the relevant database entries according to the User's request. The test case will include detailed
information concerning the location and relevant information concerning error reporting and fix. Error cases will be
assigned to the respective Engineer for repair. Test cases will be assigned a deadline based on severity.

    Tests will:
        - Ensure every method it tested with at least one negative and one positive test for each test case
        - Tests are designed to cover the scope of possible test failures
        - Test that all tests have API endpoints
        - Test that all API endpoints must handle exceptions


    Employee DAO tests:
        - Test to get employee success (test_get_employee_by_id_success)
        - Test to get employee non-existent id (test_get_employee_non_existent)

    Employee Service tests:
        -
        -

    Reimbursement DAO tests:
        - Test to ensure good request_id creation
        - Test for bad creation - request_id not created
        - Test to ensure duplicate requests can not be created.

    Reimbursement Service test:
        - non str comment
        - amount requested over limit of 1000
        - can not request negative amount
        - Test for non-supported type of reimbursement upon request creation
        - Tests to ensure a request is inbetween 1 and 1000 dollars
        - test for request amount to be float / non str
        - test for comment less than 100 char
        - test for successful
        -


    Login layer tests:
     - test successful login
     - test successful log-out



**The test plan usually includes the following information:

* 1. The overall objective of the testing effort.
2. A detailed outline of how testing will be conducted (the test approach).
3. The features, applications, or components to be tested.
4. Detailed scheduling and resource allocation plans for testers and developers throughout all stages of testing.

**A test case should include the following information.

1. A unique name or number to identify it.
2. The features, applications, or components covered by the test case.
3. Specific data values required for input fields and button controls to be tested.
4. The predicted results of actions taken during testing (the expected outcome).
5. A description of the actual results following each action taken during testing (the actual outcome).
6. An indication of whether the test case was successful.
7. Any errors discovered.
