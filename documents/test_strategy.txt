                                ***TEST STRATEGY FOR NOVO EDGE TECHNOLOGIES***


1) Bug Reporting Policy for Novo Edge  (Backend Users)

    * Issue raised in Stand-Up:
        * We discuss what the issue is, where (file, line of code)/when it appeared
        * If possible, we provide a screenshot
        * We troubleshoot as a team
    * Resolution is written up, detailing the problem and solution, emailed to the programmer and archived in a Bugs
        repository, filed by program, bug type, and specific location in the program for easy retrieval and research.
    * A bi-weekly review of the Bugs repository promotes continuous learning and de-bugging capability

2) Creating API Endpoints
    * Define routes in Flask
    * Build in functionality to handle exceptions
    * Use RESTFUL Practices
    * Test with Postman to ensure routes handle errors

3) Best Practices
    * Use proper naming conventions
    * Use of comments to inform users/developers of method function
    * Avoid use of abbreviations
