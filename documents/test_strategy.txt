                                ***TEST STRATEGY***


[] Bug reporting  (Backend Users)
    - Raise issue ticket in GitHub
	 - Request developer to leave descriptive comments about bug including:
            - Name
            - What happened:
            - What was selected to produce the error
            - What type of interaction caused the error
     - If possible provide a screenshot of the error
            - Suggestions for repair
	 - What other lines of code could these errors have affected in the application
 	 - Line/s location of the error
 - Developer who wrote code
    - leave comment(#) in code line
Issue is assigned to team member or taken on as a group activity to follow through with the resolution process from
start to finish

[] Workflow to fix bugs:
    - During our next standup we discuss and identify which problems to fix in order of     importance
    - The developer who repairs the issue will file a detailed report of cause and what steps were   taken to fix the
      error.
    - An analysis will be undertaken by team to determine potential effects on other areas of the application.
    - set deadline for repair
    - information about roles and order of operations
    - Summary

[] Creating API Endpoints
    - define routes in flask
    - build in functionality to handle exceptions
    - use RESTFUL Practices when naming URI - URL
    - create user guide for using APIs / Index
    - test with postman to ensure routes handle errors


[] Best Practices
    - use proper naming conventions
        -
    - use of comments to inform users/developers of method function
    - avoid use of abbreviations
 -

        - Alpha patch written
        - Alpha patch to be reviewed
    - week 2:
        - Patch implementation and testing
        - Patch rework or review
        - Beta testing of patch functionality
    - week 3:
        - managerial review
        - patch rework or approval
        - summary submission
        - ticket closed
