                                ***TEST STRATEGY***
[] to catch bugs report to administrator
    - Users report some error to admin
        Externally
        - fork code in GitHub, comment on or fix bug
            - commit the changes to forked branch
                - create pull request
        Internal
        - Document internally in some sort of document or request/ticket management system
            - request user to leave descriptive comments about bug including:
                - Leave name
                - Line/s location of the error
                - What happened in the application
                    - What was selected to produce the error
                    - What type of interaction caused the error #CRUD?
                    - What other lines of code could these errors have affected in the application
                    - Suggestions for repair
            - leave comment(#) in code line
[] Creating API Endpoints
    - define routes in flask
    - use RESTFUL Practices when naming URI - URL
    - create user guide for using APIs / Index
[] Workflow to fix bugs:
    - identify which problems to fix in order of importance
    - set deadline for repair
    - information about roles and order of operations
    - Summary
[] Best Practices
    - use proper naming conventions
    - use of comments to inform users/developers of method function
    - avoid excessive use of abbreviations


How to report bugs:
  For bugs open issue from GitHub repository location and provide a detailed account of what problem occurred and what
action you took to cause it. If possible provide a screenshot of the error. The engineer who repairs the issue will file
a detailed report of cause and what steps were taken to fix the error. An analysis will be undertaken by team to
determine potential effects on other areas of the application.

How to create API endpoints:
  Document what specific URIs the user will need to interact with for working with specific functions of the
application. APIs with follow RESTFul naming conventions. APIs will cover the basic functionality for an employee to
enter and retrieve information from the application.
