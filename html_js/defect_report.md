# Defect Report

### Week 1: 
 Data layer working as expected however we are still ironing out our methodology to grant access upon login. We will be changing the structure of the DAL to match the functionality of the login feature as needed. Preliminary HTML and JS have been written however JS is not functional with DB interaction.

### Week 2: 
Finalized access functions and completed integration with the DAL, Service layer has been developed and tests are functional. Api routes are not working well with DB, we will need to change/update/revise SQL

### Week 3: 
"JS woes" working to correct script for adding data to table dynamically. Various peices of the JS code invoke serverside errors or no response at all. Selenium steps are not functioning as excpeted, primarily using scenario Outline to cycle through categories.
